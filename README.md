# file-compression-huffman
This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm in C++ for compressing and decompressing text files. Huffman coding is a widely used technique for lossless data compression. This implementation offers an efficient and intuitive solution for reducing the size of text files while preserving their original content.

Features : 
This project supports two functions:
1) Encode: Compresses input file passed.
2) Decode: Decompresses Huffman coded file passed back to its original file.

How to run this project? :
To run this project you need to create an executable file. You can follow the steps given below:
1) For compressing:  g++ huffman.cpp encode.cpp -o main
                     ./main

2) For decompressing: g++ huffman.cpp decode.cpp -o main
                      ./main
